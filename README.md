Specifications for Language Test Preparation Web App
Purpose
The web app is designed to enhance IELTS, TOEFL, KET, and PET preparation lessons by providing an engaging platform for speaking practice activities. It consolidates all necessary tools and resources for speaking exercises, making it easy for students to practice and for instructors to facilitate lessons.
Technologies

HTML: Structure the web app's content and layout.
CSS: Style the interface for a user-friendly and visually appealing experience.
JavaScript: Implement interactive features, logic for games, timers, and dynamic content updates.
Future Consideration: Use JSON files to store and load additional content such as questions, vocabulary, or grammar rules, enabling easy updates and scalability.

Key Features
1. Speaking Practice Questions

Customized Question Sets: Provide distinct question sets tailored to each test (IELTS, TOEFL, KET, PET) and proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
Question Display: Randomly present questions to simulate real test scenarios.
Categories: Include question types like personal opinions, descriptions, problem-solving, and role-plays to cover all speaking tasks in the exams.
Future JSON Integration: Store questions in JSON files for easy addition of new questions or categories without modifying the core code.

2. Gamification of Speaking Exercises

Point System: Award points for completing speaking tasks, answering correctly, or meeting time goals.
Progress Tracking: Display a progress bar or score tracker to motivate students.
Achievements: Unlock badges or levels for milestones (e.g., completing 10 questions, mastering a specific question type).
Feedback Mechanism: Provide constructive feedback on responses (e.g., tips on fluency or vocabulary use) using predefined hints.

3. Timed Practice

Customizable Timers: Implement timers specific to each test’s speaking section (e.g., IELTS Part 1: 4-5 minutes, TOEFL Independent Task: 45 seconds).
Visual and Audio Cues: Show a countdown timer and play an alert sound when time is up.
Practice Modes: Offer timed and untimed modes for flexibility in practice sessions.

4. Grammar Section

Common Errors: List frequent grammar mistakes (e.g., subject-verb agreement, article usage) with explanations and examples.
Key Tenses: Highlight tenses commonly used in speaking exams (e.g., present simple, past simple, present perfect) with usage rules and example sentences.
Key Phrases: Provide a library of useful phrases for introductions, transitions, and conclusions tailored to each test.
Interactive Exercises: Include fill-in-the-blank or sentence correction tasks to reinforce grammar rules.

5. Vocabulary Review Games

Hangman: A game to review vocabulary words relevant to each test, with hints related to the word’s meaning or usage.
Tic-Tac-Toe: A two-player game where answering vocabulary or grammar questions correctly allows a player to place their mark (X or O).
Game Integration: Link games to specific test levels and vocabulary lists, with the option to load new word sets via JSON in the future.
Score Tracking: Track wins or correct answers to encourage competition and engagement.

Technical Requirements

Single-Page Application: Build a single index.html file that runs entirely in the browser without server-side dependencies.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensure the app works on any computer with a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Responsive Design: Use CSS to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Local Storage: Use browser local storage to save user progress, scores, or preferences (e.g., preferred test type or level).
Modular Code: Structure JavaScript code modularly to allow easy addition of new features or question sets.
Offline Capability: Ensure the app functions offline by embedding all necessary resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and initial question data) in the index.html file or associated files.

Future Enhancements

JSON Content Loading: Implement functionality to load questions, vocabulary, or grammar rules from external JSON files for easy content updates.
Multi-Language Support: Add support for non-English instructions or questions to cater to diverse learners.
Analytics Dashboard: Provide teachers with a dashboard to track student progress or common errors.
Audio Recording: Allow students to record and playback their responses for self-assessment (subject to browser compatibility).

User Interface

Navigation: A simple menu to switch between tests (IELTS, TOEFL, KET, PET), grammar section, and games.
Clean Design: Use a minimalistic, distraction-free design with clear buttons and text.
Feedback Display: Show immediate feedback for games and speaking tasks (e.g., correct/incorrect answers, timer status).
Accessibility: Ensure the app is accessible with keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

Development Considerations

Modularity: Separate JavaScript logic for questions, timers, games, and grammar into distinct modules for maintainability.
Error Handling: Include basic error handling for invalid inputs or missing data.
Testing: Test the app across multiple browsers to ensure compatibility and performance.
Scalability: Design the app to accommodate future features like JSON-based content or additional games without major refactoring.
